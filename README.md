## Overview

This repository contains the front-end code for an e-commerce product page, aiming to provide a functional, scalable, and up-to-date user interface. The project utilizes React for building the UI components and Redux Toolkit for state management. The goal is to create a modular and maintainable codebase, showcasing best practices for developing a modern e-commerce product page.

## Features

- **React Components:** The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The components are designed to be modular and reusable, following best practices for React development.

- **Redux Toolkit:** State management is handled efficiently with Redux Toolkit. This provides a centralized store for managing the application's state, making it easier to handle complex data flows and interactions.

- **Modular Styles with React Styles Modules:** The styling is implemented using React Styles Modules, allowing for modular and scoped styling. This ensures that styles do not leak into other components and promotes a more maintainable codebase.

- **Responsive Design with Mobile-First Approach:** The project is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices. The mobile-first approach is adopted to prioritize mobile users and then enhance the layout for larger screens.
